Basic Relational Structure of the Various Components of a Disaster Event in EM-DAT

EM-DAT data model records disasters and maps their impacts at the country level. Accordingly, the EM-DAT database references disasters with a unique identifier (see `DisNo.` in [Column Description](https://doc.emdat.be/docs/data-structure-and-content/emdat-public-table/#column-description)). A disaster may affect more than one country. In EM-DAT, the country-specific information about the disaster is recorded as an “Impact.” The Impact is the level at which EM-DAT reports entries in the [EM-DAT Public Table](https://doc.emdat.be/docs/data-structure-and-content/emdat-public-table/). To document each Impact, we cross-validate and select information from the sources that are available (see [EM-DAT sources](https://doc.emdat.be/docs/data-structure-and-content/emdat-sources/) and [Protocols](https://doc.emdat.be/docs/protocols/)).

The figure below provides a visual representation of the foundational structure of the EM-DAT database’s relational model. On the left is the core structure, and on the right, a hypothetical case serves as an illustrative example. To enhance clarity, the relations have been streamlined, omitting certain tables such as dictionaries, focusing solely on the main connections and the underlying logic of the database.

Cardinality, or the nature of the relationship between entities, is denoted by numbers or the letter “N” on each link. For instance, “1, N” signifies a one-to-many relationship. A clear example of this is the link between the “Disaster” and “Impact” tables. This implies that a single disaster entry might correspond to multiple impacts across various countries. Consider a flood affecting multiple nations, such as Belgium and Germany; the connection between these entries is facilitated by the shared `DisNo.` attribute.

The primary [classification of a disaster](https://doc.emdat.be/docs/data-structure-and-content/disaster-classification-system/), such as its main type, is housed in the “Disaster” table. Consequently, all impacts linked by the same `DisNo.` will have a consistent primary disaster type. However, EM-DAT introduces a nuance with [associated disasters](https://doc.emdat.be/docs/data-structure-and-content/disaster-classification-system/#associated-disasters) linked to the “Impact” table. Unlike the main type, these associated disasters can vary by country. They represent secondary disasters that either result from or occur simultaneously with the main event. An example would be a landslide triggered by a primary flood event, which is considered to be an associated disaster. It’s important to note that associated disasters are optional, leading to their zero-to-many relationship with the “Impact” table.

Each [source](https://doc.emdat.be/docs/data-structure-and-content/emdat-sources/) can provide data for any given variable within the Impact category. During the validation process (as detailed in [Encoding, Quality Control, and Validation Procedure](https://doc.emdat.be/docs/protocols/encoding-qc-and-validation/)), one value is chosen for each variable, which is independent of other variables. Some figures presented in the [EM-DAT Public Table](https://doc.emdat.be/docs/data-structure-and-content/emdat-public-table/) are aggregates of various variables and might originate from multiple distinct sources. For example, figures for deaths and missing persons might be reported at different times after an event. After evaluating and selecting from the available data, the `Total Deaths` column might consolidate information from various sources.
