Content and Presentation of the Database as Publicly Available

## Overview

The EM-DAT Public Table is a flat representation of EM-DAT data in a single [downloadable table](https://doc.emdat.be/docs/data-accessibility/#how-to-download-the-em-dat-public-data). Most impact variables are part of the public table (see [Impact Variables](https://doc.emdat.be/docs/data-structure-and-content/impact-variables/)). The public table provides a flat view of the [general structure](https://doc.emdat.be/docs/data-structure-and-content/core-structure-of-the-database/) in which each record (row) corresponds to a disaster impacting a country.

## Column Description
